/**
 * Builds each contestant row's per-module breakdown and re-ranks on the
 * combined result.
 *
 * The source's `points` already holds secure-development's score (it comes from
 * the scorer), so that module is ATTRIBUTED rather than added — adding it would
 * double count. The quiz, classic and ai modules score APP-SIDE: the scorer
 * never sees a quiz answer, a captured flag, or an ai challenge solve, so
 * their points are NOT already inside `entry.points` — they are ADDED on top
 * (`entry.points += quizPoints + classicPoints + aiPoints`). The two verbs
 * are not interchangeable in either direction: attributing an app-side
 * module would show zero, adding secure-development's would double count.
 *
 * Runs BEFORE withHintPenalties (see the pipeline comment in
 * `app/(site)/leaderboard/page.tsx`): every module block shows its GROSS
 * contribution, and the hint penalty nets the row's TOTAL exactly once, at
 * the end — the −N hints marker beside the header is what reconciles the
 * blocks against it. This re-ranks UNCONDITIONALLY; withHintPenalties
 * re-ranks again after deducting.
 *
 * Individuals read each app-side module's aggregate counters (`getQuizTotals`
 * / `getClassicTotals` / `getAiTotals` — two `HGETALL`s each, cost independent
 * of board size, mirroring `getHintPenalties`). Teams CANNOT: a team's total
 * is the UNION of the questions its members answered correctly (spec D6) /
 * the challenges they solved, and the aggregates have no memory of WHICH
 * items contributed to a login's total, so summing them would double count
 * anything two teammates both hold. Teams are handled by
 * `getTeamQuizTotalsBatch` / `getTeamClassicTotalsBatch` /
 * `getTeamAiTotalsBatch`, which read every member's item hash directly — all
 * of them in ONE pipeline for the whole board — and dedupe per team through
 * the shared fold in `team-fold.ts`; see its doc comment. Those batch reads
 * run in `withTeamQuizPoints` / `withTeamClassicPoints` / `withTeamAiPoints`
 * below, which `withTeamStandings` calls once over every team on the board —
 * this function itself stamps only the secure-development chip on a team, so
 * that each module reaches each team's total exactly once.
 *
 * The board's login set is the UNION of the source's logins and the logins
 * holding module points, so a contestant with quiz, classic or ai points but
 * no scored submission — every contestant on a quiz-only, classic-only or
 * ai-only event, where the source is `emptySource` and carries no rows at
 * all — gets a row CREATED for them here rather than being invisible until
 * their first scored PR. The union is taken case-insensitively (the scorer
 * records the PR author's login, the app-side modules the session's; a case
 * disagreement must not split one contestant into two rows), and a created
 * row is the only kind with no scoring entry behind it — so there is nothing
 * on it to double count, and every scorer-supplied field
 * (`patched`/`failed`/`total`/`apps`) stays zero-valued on it. A login
 * holding points in more than one app-side module gets ONE created row
 * carrying every block, never one row per module.
 *
 * Rows are only ever created from totals actually read: a failed
 * `getQuizTotals`/`getClassicTotals`/`getAiTotals` degrades to that module's
 * absence from the board, never to invented or zero-point rows.
 *
 * Hint penalties are applied by `withHintPenalties`, which runs AFTER this
 * (the pipeline's last stage), so created rows and synthesised team rows are
 * penalised like any other — the fix for hints being free on module-only
 * events.
