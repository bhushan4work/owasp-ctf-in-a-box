/**
 * Overlays live team MEMBERSHIP (from the team store's ctf:team:* records)
 * onto leaderboard data from a source that has no team concept (upstash, and
 * the empty source a quiz-only event uses). Such a source only has each
 * player's per-login TOTAL, not which flag earned which point — so it has no
 * way to tell whether two teammates' totals overlap on a flag they both
 * solved. Summing member totals into a team score would double-count any such
 * shared flag, so a synthesised row deliberately fabricates no SCORER points:
 * it starts at `points: 0`. Real (deduped) secure-development team points
 * require the scorer/lambda path, which computes them from per-flag data
 * upstream and sets `capabilities.teams = true` before this function ever runs.
 *
 * Module points ARE added — to the rows synthesised here AND to the source's
 * own teams, in this one place and nowhere else (issue #520) — via
 * `withTeamQuizPoints`, `withTeamClassicPoints` and `withTeamAiPoints` — the
 * quiz stores which QUESTION each member answered, classic which CHALLENGE
 * each member solved, and ai which CHALLENGE each member solved, so a team's
 * total can be deduped by item (an item three teammates hold counts once)
 * with no per-flag scorer data involved. Leaving them at zero meant a
 * quiz-only (or classic-only, or ai-only) event opened on its DEFAULT view —
 * the teams board, whenever teams exist — with every team tied at nothing
 * while the individual view showed real points. The attribution deliberately
 * lives in `module-contributions.ts` and is merely CALLED from here, so the
 * union rule has exactly one implementation; the pipeline order is unchanged.
 *
 * The three are applied in sequence, each adding only its own module's
 * points and re-ranking on the running total, and each no-ops when its
 * module is disabled — so a single-module event pays for exactly one of
 * them.
 *
 * Membership is matched case-insensitively, like every other login join in
 * this codebase: rows created from module points carry the module store's
 * spelling of the login, and a case disagreement with the team record would
 * otherwise silently drop the team chip.
 *
 * When the team store holds no teams, or cannot be read, membership is left
 * as the source reported it — a team-less view on a source with no teams of
 * its own, rather than failing the whole leaderboard. The source's own teams
 * (scorer/lambda) still get their module points in that case: this is the one
 * place those are added, so skipping it would drop them, not just the
 * app-side rows.

  // actually created — with a captain, a join code and a roster. This function
  // used to return early on `capabilities.teams`, so one team in the source was
  // enough to drop every app-side team from the board and leave every entry
  // team-less, including members of the source's own teams. A live event hit it
  // through the DEMO_MODE seeder: three seeded teams in the scorer permanently
  // hid the organizer's real team, silently, and a redeploy did not clear it
  // because seeds are data (issue #413).
  //
  // So the source's rows are KEPT rather than recomputed — that is the part
  // this function cannot do, per the note above: only the scorer has the
  // per-flag data to dedupe a secure-development flag two teammates both
  // solved, and re-synthesising those rows here would fabricate or double-count
  // points. App-side teams the source does not know are appended beside them,
  // starting at `points: 0` for exactly the same reason.
