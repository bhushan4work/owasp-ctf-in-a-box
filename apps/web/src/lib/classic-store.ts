/**
 * The classic (jeopardy-style flag) module. This file is the only place that
 * touches `ctf:classic:*` Redis keys during normal contestant and authoring
 * activity — submitting, grading, and challenge authoring/deletion all go
 * through it, and nothing else should read or write these keys for those
 * flows. The same deliberate exception quiz-store.ts documents applies here:
 * admin-store.ts's bulk-maintenance paths (demo seed, master reset) reuse the
 * key names from classic-keys.ts directly rather than going through these
 * functions.
 *
 * Key layout:
 *   ctf:classic:challenges       hash, id -> JSON Challenge (public-safe; this
 *                                 is what contestants see)
 *   ctf:classic:flag             hash, id -> the flag AS AUTHORED, trimmed
 *                                 (SECRET from contestants). Written for the
 *                                 admin edit form ALONE and read by exactly
 *                                 one function, `listChallengesForAdmin`. The
 *                                 grading script never reads it — see below.
 *   ctf:classic:flagnorm         hash, id -> `normalizeFlag(flag)` (SECRET).
 *                                 The ONLY value grading ever compares
 *                                 against.
 *   ctf:classic:categories       string, JSON array of category names in the
 *                                 organizer's chosen display order.
 *   ctf:classic:solves:<login>   hash, id -> JSON {points, at} — records ONLY
 *                                 solves. Points are captured at solve time,
 *                                 so a later re-pricing of a challenge never
 *                                 rewrites history.
 *   ctf:classic:attempts:<login> hash, id -> JSON {attempts, firstAt, lastAt, lastAtMs}
 *        firstAt is the FIRST submission's time and is carried forward across
 *        rewrites; absent on rows written before it existed.
 *                                 — every submission, right or wrong; the
 *                                 cooldown reads this. `lastAtMs` (a plain
 *                                 epoch-ms mirror of `lastAt`) exists only so
 *                                 SUBMIT_SCRIPT can do cooldown arithmetic in
 *                                 Lua without parsing an ISO-8601 string;
 *                                 readers outside this file should use `lastAt`.
 *   ctf:classic:points           hash, login -> running points total
 *   ctf:classic:solved           hash, login -> running solve count
 *   ctf:classic:lastAt           hash, login -> ISO time of the latest award,
 *                                 the leaderboard's tiebreak
 *   ctf:classic:solvecount       hash, challenge id -> DISTINCT solver count
 *
 * TWO flag hashes, on purpose. `flagnorm` is what grading compares; `flag` is
 * what an organizer sees when editing. They are written together in one
 * pipeline so they cannot observably disagree, and only `flagnorm` is ever
 * handed to Redis's scripting path.
 *
 * Normalization (`normalizeFlag`, in classic-keys.ts) happens in JS on BOTH
 * paths — authoring and submission — and NEVER in Lua. Lua's `string.lower` is
 * ASCII-only, so a Lua-side normalization of any non-ASCII flag would disagree
 * with the authoring side and produce a challenge nobody can solve.
 *
 * Secrecy boundary — a CONTESTANT boundary, not an absolute one, mirroring
 * `ctf:quiz:key`. Two readers, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *   - `listChallenges` (the CONTESTANT path — `/flags`, the leaderboard
 *     overlay) never issues a command against `ctf:classic:flag` OR
 *     `ctf:classic:flagnorm`, and the `Challenge` type it returns has no field
 *     that could carry a flag. That property is absolute and must stay that
 *     way.
 *   - `listChallengesForAdmin` (the ADMIN path — `GET /api/admin/classic`,
 *     behind `requireAdmin`) DOES read `ctf:classic:flag`, and returns it in a
 *     separate `AdminChallenge` shape that is deliberately not assignable to
 *     `Challenge` (see its doc comment). Withholding the flag from an
 *     organizer editing the challenge buys nothing — anyone through that gate
 *     can already rewrite or delete it — while costing real correctness: an
 *     edit form that starts with an empty flag box turns every typo fix into a
 *     chance to silently redefine what counts as solved.
 *
 * Grading (which reads `ctf:classic:flagnorm`) is likewise server-only and is
 * never exposed by a route that echoes its input back to the caller.
 *
 * Callers (the /api/classic route handlers) are responsible for authenticating
 * the session and deriving `login` server-side — nothing here trusts
 * client-supplied identity.

 *     still say `from`, and a retry of the same rename would refuse, because
 *     `from` is not there to rename. The organizer would have to work
 *     out the inverse rename themselves.
 *
 * Either partial state still RENDERS: `bucketRows` (components/admin) appends
 * a group the category list does not name rather than dropping its rows, so no
 * challenge goes invisible while a rename is half applied.
 *
 * Refuses rather than merges when `to` already exists, case-insensitively —
 * the same fold `setCategories` dedupes on. Merging two categories is a
 * different and lossier operation; it should be asked for explicitly, not
 * arrived at by typing an existing name into a rename box. Changing only the

 *  before calling this is the one at fault, not something this function

 *  against a live board: an organizer can import a partial file (this
 *  week's new challenges, say) without erasing anything else already
 *  authored. Existing ids are read FIRST (one HKEYS) so `created`/`updated`
 *  reflect what was already on the board before this call, not what ends up
 *  there after.
 *
 *  Categories are UNIONED, never replaced: the existing order is preserved
 *  and any category new to the store is appended in the bundle's own order
 *  (case-insensitive membership check, mirroring `setCategories`). Replacing
 *  the list outright would silently drop or reorder categories belonging to
 *  challenges this bundle never mentions — part of the board the organizer
 *  wasn't touching.
 *
 *  All challenge/flag/flagnorm writes plus the categories write happen in
 *  ONE `upstashPipeline` call — the same discipline `upsertChallenge` follows
 *  for a single row — so those hashes (and the category list) can never
 *  observably disagree partway through a bulk import. The membership reads

// Grades one flag submission and records everything it changes atomically.
//
// This script — NOT the JS pre-check — is the authority on the cooldown. The
// pre-check reads over its own separate round trip, so two concurrent
// submissions can both observe "not cooling" before either writes. Redis runs
// one script to completion before starting the next, so each submission here
// sees every effect of every submission that finished before it.
//
//   1. HGET the normalized flag. Missing -> {'missing'} (bad/deleted id).
//   2. HEXISTS the solve row BEFORE any write -> {'already'}, nothing touched.
//      This guard is also what makes KEYS[6] (solvecount) distinct-by-
//      construction: a login can never increment it twice.
//   3. Read {attempts,lastAtMs} and re-check the cooldown WITHOUT WRITING.
//      The cooldown comes in as ARGV (the CURRENT admin setting, resolved by
//      the caller on every call — never a stored cutoff) and is combined with
//      the attempts row the script reads at execution time, never a value the
//      caller read earlier and handed in, which is what would let a race
//      bypass it.
//   4. Only past the check: spend an attempt (right or wrong).
//   5. Compare whole values with `==`. A flag routinely contains braces,
//      quotes and backslashes, so it is never pattern-matched out of a JSON
//      blob the way quiz's points are — the value IS the whole hash field.
//      And it is compared against ARGV[2], which the CALLER normalized with
//      the same `normalizeFlag` that produced the stored value. Nothing here
//      lowercases anything: Lua's `string.lower` is ASCII-only and would
//      disagree with the JS recipe on any non-ASCII flag, producing a
//      challenge nobody can solve.
//   6. Equal: read points, write the solve row, bump the three counters.
//
// DRY RUN (ARGV[8] == "1", admin preview): steps 1-2 and 5 run as
// normal; the cooldown refusal (3) is skipped and NOTHING is written — no
// attempts row (4), no solve or counters (6). The verdict comes back with a
// trailing 'dry' so the caller can never mistake it for a banked solve.
//
// The points match is anchored with a trailing [,}] so it can only match a
// complete "points":<int> pair, not a digit run appearing earlier in the blob.
